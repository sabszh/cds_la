    "We're going to be working with ```FLAN-T5```, a text-to-text model developed by Google. ```FLAN-T5``` is based on ```T5```, which we saw in the lecture, but it has been further finetuned on a range of common text-to-text tasks. This means that it can already perform a lot of the kinds of tasks that people use generative language models for. You can read more in the paper here: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf)\n",
