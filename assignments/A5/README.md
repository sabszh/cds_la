# Assignment 5 - Evaluating Environmental Impact of Exam Portfolio

## Assignment Description
This assignment evaluates the environmental impact of the work completed in the Cultural Data Science course throughout the semester. CodeCarbon, a tool that measures the CO₂ emissions of code, is utilized to assess the environmental footprint of the assignments. The main focus is to determine which assignments and tasks have contributed the most to CO₂ emissions and to discuss the implications of these findings.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Data was collected from each assignment in the Language Analytics course, including A1, A2, A3, and A4.
2. **CO₂ Emissions Measurement**: CodeCarbon was used to measure the CO₂ emissions generated by the code in each assignment.
3. **Analysis**: The results were analyzed to identify the assignment and tasks that generated the most emissions. The robustness of these findings was also assessed, and potential areas for improvement were discussed.

## Results
### Assignment with Highest Emissions

Assignment 4 (Emotion analysis with pretrained language model) generated the highest emissions in terms of CO₂eq. The emission was equal to 88.60% of the total generated emission across all assignments. 

### Tasks with Highest Emissions

The task on predicting emotions in assignment 4 was the one producing most emissions - namely 99.86%. 

### Robustness of Results
The results are fairly robust as they are based on actual measurements of CO₂ emissions using CodeCarbon. However, there are some limitations, such as the lack of granularity in task-level emissions measurement. Improvements could be made by refining the measurement methodology and accounting for additional factors that may influence emissions.

## Repository Contents
- **CSV Files**: Contains the CO₂ emissions data generated by CodeCarbon for each assignment.
- **Output Folder**: Contains the plots generated of the emissions.
- **Script**: Contains code for generaiting the plots.
